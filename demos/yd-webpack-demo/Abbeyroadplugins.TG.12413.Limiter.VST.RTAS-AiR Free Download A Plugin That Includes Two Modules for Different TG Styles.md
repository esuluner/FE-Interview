Now that you have installed the Abbeyroadplugins TG12413 Limiter VST RTAS for free, you might be wondering how to use it on your tracks. Here are some tips and tricks to get the most out of this plug-in:

- The plug-in has two modes: compressor and limiter. You can switch between them by clicking on the COMP/LIM button. The compressor mode has a 2:1 ratio and a fixed threshold of -10 dB. The limiter mode has a variable threshold and up to 20 dB of gain reduction.
- The plug-in has four main controls: INPUT, OUTPUT, RECOVERY and HOLD. The INPUT control adjusts the level of the signal going into the plug-in. The OUTPUT control adjusts the level of the signal coming out of the plug-in. The RECOVERY control sets the release time of the compression or limiting. The HOLD control sets the attack time of the compression or limiting.
- The plug-in also has a bypass switch and a gain reduction meter. The bypass switch allows you to compare the processed and unprocessed signals. The gain reduction meter shows how much compression or limiting is applied to the signal.
- The plug-in can be used on individual tracks or on the master bus. It can add warmth, punch, glue and loudness to your mixes. However, be careful not to overdo it, as it can also cause distortion, pumping and clipping if used excessively.
- The plug-in can be used in mono, stereo or multi-channel configurations. It supports up to 7.1 surround operation. You can adjust the width and balance of the stereo image by using the WIDTH and BALANCE controls in the plug-in window.
- The plug-in can be automated and controlled by a MIDI controller or a control surface. You can assign any parameter to a MIDI CC number or a control surface knob by right-clicking on it and choosing "Learn MIDI CC" or "Learn Control Surface". You can also save and recall presets by using the preset menu in the plug-in window.
